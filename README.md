Functions to aggregate WBD HUC12s
=================================

Go here for data needed for this package: ftp://ftpint.usgs.gov/private/er/wi/middleton/dblodgett/HUCAgg/

Everything can be done with the WBDHU12.tar.gz shapefile. It was generated from the Watershed Boundary Dataset Geo Data Base that is also included at the ftpint site above. ogr2ogr was used to make that conversion.

See HUC12Agg.R for usage.
